//! This module re-exports various items from the `entity_api` crate.
//!
//! The purpose of this re-export is to ensure that consumers of the `domain` crate do not need to
//! directly depend on the `entity_api` crate. By re-exporting these items, we provide a clear and
//! consistent interface for working with query filters within the domain layer, while encapsulating
//! the underlying implementation details remain in the `entity_api` crate.
